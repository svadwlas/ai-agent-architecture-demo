# AI Agent Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates a conceptual AI agent architecture using modular components designed for intelligent automation. It simulates how a language model-driven agent can analyze input, select tools, manage memory, and return structured outputsâ€”applicable to enterprise automation use cases.

## ðŸ“¦ Key Modules

- `AgentCore`: Handles prompt routing, tool selection, and output formatting
- `Toolset`: Basic tools like search, summarizer, math, etc.
- `Memory`: Session context management (short-term, long-term)
- `Planner`: Breaks down user goals into task plans
- `Orchestrator`: Manages agent loop and tool execution

## ðŸ§  Design Principles

- Composable functions and tools
- OpenAI-compatible language model interface
- YAML-based config and planning
- Architecture aligned with LangChain/LlamaIndex-style extensibility

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the agent with a use case prompt:
```bash
python src/agent_main.py --usecase "Automate invoice data extraction and entry"
```
